    "Ans- Measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation are used to describe the spread or variability of a dataset. They provide information about how spread out the values in the dataset are from the central tendency, which can give insight into the level of variation or diversity present in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The range is the simplest measure of dispersion, and it represents the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset. It gives an indication of the spread of the dataset but is limited as it only considers the extreme values and does not account for the distribution of values in between.\n",

    "The variance and standard deviation are more robust measures of dispersion as they take into account all values in the dataset. The variance measures the average distance of each point from the mean of the dataset, while the standard deviation measures the amount of variation or deviation of the data from the mean. The larger the standard deviation or variance, the more spread out the dataset is from the mean.\n",

    "Variance:\n",
    "The variance of Class A test scores is 28.5, while the variance of Class B test scores is 200. This means that the test scores in Class B are more spread out than in Class A.\n",

    "Standard deviation:\n",
    "The standard deviation of Class A test scores is 5.3, while the standard deviation of Class B test scores is 14.1. This means that the test scores in Class B are more spread out than in Class A.\n",

This suggests that there may be more variability or diversity in the performance of students in Class B compared to Class A."
